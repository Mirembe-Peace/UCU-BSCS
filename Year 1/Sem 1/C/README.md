## Class assignments from my lectures in my structured programming course, which is in C.

#### Simple Programs
1. [Chase Bank](https://github.com/anzonathan/UCU-BSCS/blob/main/Year%201/Sem%201/C/Chase%20Bank.c) A program that simulates an ATM
2. [Electric Bill](https://github.com/anzonathan/UCU-BSCS/blob/main/Year%201/Sem%201/C/Electric%20Bill.c) Simulating a Yaka Bill
3. [Generations](https://github.com/anzonathan/UCU-BSCS/blob/main/Year%201/Sem%201/C/Generations.c) A program that tells you which generation you are.
4. [I Love Meat](https://github.com/anzonathan/UCU-BSCS/blob/main/Year%201/Sem%201/C/I%20love%20Meat.c) A program to select...honeslty I never really understood the point of this program but it was an introduction into selecting arrays
5. [Int Pointers](https://github.com/anzonathan/UCU-BSCS/blob/main/Year%201/Sem%201/C/Int%20Pointers.c) There is this data type called a pointer. Most people dont get it. But I hope you do. !!!Study this last
6. [Inventory](https://github.com/anzonathan/UCU-BSCS/blob/main/Year%201/Sem%201/C/Inventory.c) An Inventory managmenment system
7. [Switch](https://github.com/anzonathan/UCU-BSCS/blob/main/Year%201/Sem%201/C/Switch.c) We used a data scructure called a switch, its kind of like an if statement.
8. [Tables](https://github.com/anzonathan/UCU-BSCS/blob/main/Year%201/Sem%201/C/Tables.c) Generates multiplication times tables.
9. [Tmp_Converter + Bonus](https://github.com/anzonathan/UCU-BSCS/blob/main/Year%201/Sem%201/C/Tmp_Converter%20%2B%20Bonus%20.c) Converts temperature and incorperates error handling.
10. [Tmp_Converter](https://github.com/anzonathan/UCU-BSCS/blob/main/Year%201/Sem%201/C/Tmp_Converter%20%2B%20Bonus%20.c) Converts temperatures
11. [Fizzbuzz](https://github.com/anzonathan/UCU-BSCS/blob/main/Year%201/Sem%201/C/fizzbuzz.c) This is supposed to be a beginner program, but I think our lecturere may have mixed up steps. This is the real [FizzBuzz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fizz_buzz).
12. [Minutes](https://github.com/anzonathan/UCU-BSCS/blob/main/Year%201/Sem%201/C/minutes.c) Converts Minutes to other timescales. I found this tricky. Internalize it.
13. [Reverse](https://github.com/anzonathan/UCU-BSCS/blob/main/Year%201/Sem%201/C/reverse.c) This reverses a string.


#### Assignments & Tests
Some of the progrmas were commneted out. 
And in some cases the 
```c
#inlcude <stdio.h>
```
library is used for the entire file.
1. [25 Problems](https://github.com/anzonathan/UCU-BSCS/blob/main/Year%201/Sem%201/C/25%20Problems.c) 

2. [Decision Making Statement](https://github.com/anzonathan/UCU-BSCS/blob/main/Year%201/Sem%201/C/Decsion%20Making%20Statements.c) 5 assignment problems

3. [For Loops](https://github.com/anzonathan/UCU-BSCS/blob/main/Year%201/Sem%201/C/Decsion%20Making%20Statements.c) For Loop Excercises

4. [Functions](https://github.com/anzonathan/UCU-BSCS/blob/main/Year%201/Sem%201/C/Functions.c) Excercises with functions.

5. [While Loops](https://github.com/anzonathan/UCU-BSCS/blob/main/Year%201/Sem%201/C/While%20Loops%20-1.c) Excercises with While Loops 

6. [Test 1](https://github.com/anzonathan/UCU-BSCS/tree/main/Year%201/Sem%201/C/Test%20on%20Functions%20and%20Pointers) A test on Function and Pointers

7. [Sem 1 Test](https://github.com/anzonathan/UCU-BSCS/tree/main/Year%201/Sem%201/C/Year%201%20Sem%201%20Test) One of the finals we took.
