## Structured Programming - CSC1101

1. We learned how to use flow charts to plan our programs. I used [draw.io](https://app.diagrams.net/) and [figjam](https://www.figma.com/figjam/) for almost all my diagrams.
2. We were introduced to the C programming language all my code and assignment. I recomend using [Geeks for Geeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/c-programming-language/) as a learning resource. I tried the orignal C lang book by the creators of C and I found it pretty high level and written for a more experience programmer. This is all the [C code](https://github.com/anzonathan/UCU-BSCS/tree/main/Year%201/Sem%201/C) I used in class. 
3. In our tutorials we were taught how to set up our VS Code (Text Editor) so that we can compile C code within the text editor. This [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VE7p-he4fA) should help. Just email me at anzonathan@gmail.com in case you need further help.
4. At some point we used scratch to develop our programming logic.
